# Github-Actions
A sample project to play with Github Actions

#### [Actions](https://github.com/volkansahin45/Github-Actions/actions)
- [Pull Request Check](/.github/workflows/feature.yml): Builds application at every pull request to be sure the new features don't break the app.
- [Distribute Beta](/.github/workflows/beta.yml): Uploads app to the Firebase App Distribution every time when a new code pushed to the master branch.
